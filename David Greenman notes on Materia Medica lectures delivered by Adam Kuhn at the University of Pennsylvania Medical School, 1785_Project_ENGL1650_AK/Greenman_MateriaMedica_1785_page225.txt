heart and arteries before I proceed to explain its operation
I shall premise a few words upon the subject of tension
a degree of tension is necessary in the Solids to the regular
Circulation of the Fluids, this depends in part upon the
inherent contractile power of the Muscular fibres and
vascular system the tension of these parts is increased
by the action of the fluids (hence the sudden relaxation
that takes place upon plentifull Bleeding not
only in the particular part from whence the Blood
was drawn but thraughaut the System) This tension
is produced in a particular manner by the energy
of the Nervous fluids

Of the Cold Bath and its manner of operation, The tension
of the Fibres from their own contractile pawer is not equal
in all parts particularly in the Stomach and intestines they
having no Antagonist muscles and hence the necessity
of supporting the tone of the Stomach and intestines by such
stimulees as nature ocquires or the Constitution has been
accustomed to as food, Drams and other Substances which
by use are rendered habitual there is a particular

Nerves on the Superfecies of the Body which is immidiately
