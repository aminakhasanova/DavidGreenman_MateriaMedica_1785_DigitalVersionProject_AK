returning at 20 and not till 30 days, and farther if this was
the case all women would have that discharge at one time
which we know is not the case neither is the opinion
of those who ascribe it to a fermentation in the Blood
better supported for how could this happen to be excited
only at particular times and farther the Blood under-
-goes no change as the Blood discharged differs in
no respect from the other Blood with respect to opinion
of those who supported it owing to general plethora
they say that as the fetus was to be nourished in the
womb that it was necessary that the mother should
be provided with a greater quantaty of Blood than
would be otherwise necessary to perform the other
functions and that this was the cause why women
were of a more lax and delicate constitution
This will not do for there are many women of stronger
constitutions and habits of Body than Men, women who
from Childhood have been inured to hard labour, for
instance Country Girls these have their menses regularly
both as to time and quantaty but I think that the
laxity of habit in women generally arises from
a Ledendery life. that this discharge is not produced
by general plethora from its occuring a year
before the patient arives at her full growth. Therefore
