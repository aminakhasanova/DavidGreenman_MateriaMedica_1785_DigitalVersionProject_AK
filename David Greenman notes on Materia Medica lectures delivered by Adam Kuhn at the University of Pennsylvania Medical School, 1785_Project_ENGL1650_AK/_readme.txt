Explanation: 

When documenting metadata for this book, I recorded the “file_name” to match each metadata to the corresponding digital page/image and “unique_ID” to have a consistent organization of all the metadata that I collected for pages of the book that I choose to focus on. I included “creator” and “date” because I think they are basic but still important characteristics of any text when it comes to collecting information about them. “Language” was also recorded to keep track of the language used in each page just in case some other languages were introduced maybe through annotations in some of the pages. “Page_number (original)” was included to help identify which pages were numbered by the author and which pages were left out such as the index section at the end of the book. “Page_type” was used to make the structure of the notebook clearer and categorize different parts of the notebook into sections such as index, title, or owner’s notes. “Text_legibility” was used to note which pages are easier or harder to read due to smudges, markings, or just the handwriting itself. “Images_present” was used to note if any pages included illustrations which are important to know if the book contains any drawings or images. “Handwriting_type” was included to distinguish cursive from printed letters because some annotations were made in printed letters in some pages so this category helps to keep track of such annotations. “Medium_used” helps to keep track whether ink or pencil was used for the text and possible annotations. “Annotations_present” was used to keep track of any corrections or notes made by the original creator, owner, or library staff. “Overall_page_condition” and “page_edge_condition” categories were used to document the fragility, water damage, and torn/trimmed edges of the pages in order to help the readers have a better understanding of the physical state of the book if they don’t have access to the physical book. Lastly, “content_summary/keywords” was used to provide a brief idea of what each page is about. Overall, the goal of collecting these metadata was not only to allow the book to be read and understood online, but also help convey the fragility and varying conditions of the pages throughout the book, which can be difficult to understand from the images of the pages alone.
